A collection of work-related tools that I have developed. 

ivsearch2015.py / ivsearc2.py / ivfilesearch.py

These are scripts created to search a number of mounted drives simultaneously for a file.
ivsearch2015.py is the most recent.

ltohistory.py
Created to compare information provided by our LTO archiving software and media asset management software.

guiivsearch.py
GUI based version of ivsearch. This is still in development.
